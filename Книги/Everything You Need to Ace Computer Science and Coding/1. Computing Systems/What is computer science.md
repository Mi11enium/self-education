# What is computer science?

A <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">COMPUTER</mark> is a device that stores and processes (changes, moves, or rewrites) information.

It can perform <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">complicated computations</mark> and organize and store huge amounts of information. Computer science is the study of computers and how computer technology can be used to solve problems. It involves studying <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">COMPUTING SYSTEMS</mark> , programming rules, data and analysis, networking, the internet, and how computers affect our lives. Computers are bet ter than humans at storing and sharing tons of information, solving complex calculations quickly, and learning things. Computer scientists use computers' abilities to help them develop new technologies that make our lives easier.

Computer technology affects the way we live and think. It can help us solve our problems and make our lives seem easier, more fun, and safer.

For example:
- Computers helped navigate spacecraft to the moon and Mars.
- Robots help surgeons perform surgeries with great precision.
- Computers add relistic visual and sound effect to movies and video games.

Computer scientists use and create technology to solve problems. They program computers to both complete tasks bet ter and faster as well as teach them how to do new things. Becoming a computer scientist means shifting from being only a **consumer** (someone who uses something) to being a **creator**.

Computer science is a type of problem solving; it includes the study of computers, their design, and the way they process information

Examples of what computer science IS and IS NOT
